That narrative is compelling for some, but leaves others feeling hopeless, helpless, and disillusioned. Even the most ardent champions of decarbonization sometimes focus more on sounding the alarm than on mapping out what success might look like. Without positive climate futures, visions of climate adaptation and resilience that we can work toward, it&rsquo;s much harder to motivate broad-based efforts for change in the present.Through short speculative fiction, essays, and visual art, Climate Imagination seeks to inspire a wave of narratives about what positive climate futures might look like for communities around the world.

Account logins, controllers, and an assortment of menus, settings, and other peripheral-to-gameplay elements support a range of practical and necessary functions that result from the transformation of gameplay into digital gameplay, as well as broader shifts toward an increasingly networked and data-driven world. The games industry has adopted usability testing on top of play testing to evaluate how these interfaces may influence the accessibility and success of their game software, but how embedding gameplay within webs of software, hardware, and platform infrastructures impacts the medium, players, and production has not yet been fully explored.In Thresholds of Digital Gameplay, Daniel Gardner demonstrates how a series of interfaces and other elements on the periphery of digital gameplay fundamentally alter the phenomena of gaming.

If youâ€™re not living uptown, you might as well be dead. Such is the case of Darius Smith, an artistic youth living in the hood, doing his best to avoid trouble and live life.Â Unfortunately, Darius has a hidden talentÂ â€”Â heâ€™s an explosive fighter! This makes him the target of several gangs and pits him in many brawls, landing him in the sight of the honorable Timothy Mustafa, a powerful prince. XOGENASYS is a successful gladiator sport fought with powered exoskeletons, and as the owner of one of the most successful teams in the country, Mustafa wants Darius to become his newest fighter. Can Darius become the next champion? Or will he fall like so many before him?""This is an underdog tale, and one that is effectively told; it feels reminiscent of a sports biopic with narrative. Something about the execution of this story feels raw and relatable. It might be the expressiveness in the art, or the way the dialogue matches how real people speak to each other. Regardless, XOGENASYS Volume 1 is a rousingly successful debut for Noir Caesarâ€“I am fully invested for the ride and eagerly awaiting more.""Â â€” Marion Pena,Â The Comics Beat""Draper-Iveyâ€™s artwork gears toward gritty black-and-white with striking action scenes. Itâ€™s a slow burn, but readers will easily root for the underdog protagonist as he battles his way out of poverty.
